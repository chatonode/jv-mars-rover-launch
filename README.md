# ðŸš€ Mars Rover Launch ðŸš€
## Overview

> This project is built for sending multiple rovers to the plateau of fellow planet Mars.

`jv-mars-rover-launch` is a Java console application that simulates the exploration of rovers on different planets. Users can define a plateau, add rovers to a launch station, and perform various operations on Earth and Mars, such as launching rovers and navigating them across the surface of Mars.

## Features
### Plateau Creation
- **Define Plateau**: Users can create a plateau by specifying the maximum `x` and `y` dimensions.

### Earth Operations
- **Add Rover**: Add a rover to Earth's launch station list, which will be ready for a future launch.
- **Fetch Rovers**: Retrieve and display all rovers currently on Earth.
- **Launch Rovers**: Launch all prepared rovers from Earth to Mars, to their defined `initial position`.

### Mars Operations
- **View Plateau**: Display a 2D representation of the plateau on Mars with all active rovers.
- **Move Rover**: Move a specific rover across the plateau.
- **Rotate Rover**: Rotate a specific rover to change its direction for next potential movement.
- **List All Rovers**: Display all rovers currently on Mars.
- **Filter Rovers**: List rovers on Mars based on specific filters (e.g., position, direction, produced year).

## Architecture

The application is structured with a clear separation of concerns across different layers:

- `input`: Handles parsing of user inputs.
- `view`: **Output Manager** handles displaying the presentation of information to the user, communicating with `controller` and `input`.
- `controller`: **Mission Control** implements the core business logic, orchestrating operations between the various components, validating them and handling resource creating exceptions well.
- `Main`: is the entrance point of entire application

## Testing

The project is developed with **Java 21** in **IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition** and includes comprehensive testing using **JUnit**. Most of the business logic is well-covered with unit tests to ensure the correctness and reliability of the application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java 21 SDK**: Make sure you have Java 21 installed. You can download it from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk21-archive-downloads.html) or use an open-source distribution like [Temurin](https://adoptium.net/).
- **Maven**: Install Apache Maven for dependency management and to build the project.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/chatonode/jv-mars-rover-launch.git
    cd jv-mars-rover-launch
    ```

2. **Open the Project in IntelliJ IDEA**:
    - Launch IntelliJ IDEA.
    - Click on **File > Open...** and navigate to the cloned `jv-mars-rover-launch` directory.
    - Select the directory and click **Open**.
    - IntelliJ will automatically detect the Maven project and import it. If prompted, select to "Enable Auto-Import" for Maven dependencies.

3. **Build the Project**:
    - In IntelliJ, go to the **Maven** tool window (usually located on the right side of the IDE).
    - Click on the **Reload** button in the Maven tool window to ensure all dependencies are downloaded.

4. **Run the Application**:
    - Locate the `Main` class in your project (e.g., `src/main/java/com/yourpackage/Main.java`).
    - Right-click on the `Main` class and select **Run 'Main'**.
    - The console will display the output of the application, and you can interact with it through the IntelliJ terminal.

### Running Tests

To run the tests, execute the following command:

```bash
mvn test
```

This command will run all the unit tests in the project, ensuring that the business logic works as expected.

## Continuous Integration (CI)

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration. The CI pipeline is defined in `.github/workflows/maven.yml` and performs the following steps:

- **Checkout the Code**: Pulls the latest code from the repository.
- **Set up Java 21**: Configures the environment with Java 21 using the Temurin distribution.
- **Build with Maven**: Compiles the project and packages it.
- **Run Tests**: Executes all JUnit tests to ensure the code is functioning correctly.

## Usage

After starting the application, you will be prompted to create a plateau by specifying the maximum x and y coordinates. You can then choose to perform operations on Earth or Mars, following a series of intuitive prompts.

### Example Workflow

1. **Create a plateau** with dimensions (5, 5).
2. **Select Earth** to add rovers to the launch station.
3. **Launch** the rovers to Mars.
4. **On Mars**, view the plateau and move/rotate rovers as needed.
